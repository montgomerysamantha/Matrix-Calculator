# project-6-cis-200

Java program that reads in an input file that contains two matrices. The name of the input file is supplied by a command-line argument. It then repeatedly loops and asks the user if they want to print, add, subtract, multiply, transpose, or quit.

This program was created for the class CIS 200 Programming Fundamentals at Kansas State University. Â© Samantha Montgomery, 2017.
